What is the time complexity of accessing an element in a list?
a) O(1)
b) O(n)
c) O(log n)
d) O(n^2)
a
Accessing an element by index in a list is an O(1) operation because lists are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing direct access.

What will the output of the following code be?
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
y.append(4)
print(x)
a) [1, 2, 3]
b) [1, 2, 3, 4]
c) [4, 1, 2, 3]
d) Error
b
In Python, x and y are references to the same list. Modifying y affects x as they point to the same object in memory.

Which of the following is used to create a virtual environment in Python?
a) virtualenv
b) envcreate
c) pyenv
d) venv
a
virtualenv is a tool for creating isolated Python environments. Although venv is also correct, the question asks for a tool, and virtualenv is more widely known as a package for creating virtual environments.

What is the output of the following code?
x = {1, 2, 3}
x.add(2)
print(x)
a) {1, 2, 3}
b) {1, 2}
c) {1, 2, 3, 2}
d) Error
a
Sets in Python only contain unique elements. Adding 2 again doesn't change the set since it already contains 2.

What does the following code return?
list(map(str, [1, 2, 3]))
a) ['1', '2', '3']
b) ['1', '2', 3]
c) [1, 2, 3]
d) Error
a
The map function applies str() to each element in the list [1, 2, 3], converting each element to a string.

What is the output of the following code?
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(x * 2)
a) [1, 2, 3]
b) [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
c) [2, 3]
d) Error
b
Multiplying a list by 2 in Python repeats the list elements twice, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3].

What will be the output of the following code?
def add(*args):
    return sum(args)
print(add(1, 2, 3))
a) 6
b) 5
c) 3
d) Error
a
The *args syntax allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to the function. The sum function adds them together, returning 6.

What does the following code print?
for i in range(3):
    print(i, end=' ')
print()
a) 0 1 2
b) 0 1 2 
c) 1 2 3
d) Error
a
The range(3) generates numbers 0, 1, and 2. The end=' ' in the print statement ensures the values are printed on the same line with a space between them.

Which of the following is not a built-in data type in Python?
a) List
b) Tuple
c) Array
d) Dictionary
c
Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are all built-in Python data types. Arrays are not a native Python data type but can be implemented using the array module or through external libraries like numpy.

def test(x, func):
    return func(x)
print(test(5, lambda x: x * x))
print(test(3, lambda x: x + 10))
a) 25 13
b) 25 3
c) Error
d) 5 10
a
This code demonstrates the use of a lambda function. The test function takes an argument x and another argument func, which is a function. The lambda expressions are used to define the behavior of func for different operations, i.e., squaring and adding 10.
